# Usama Sadiq Portfolio

This repository contains my personal portfolio powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It is ready for hosting on GitHub Pages and provides a structure for both project pages and blog posts.

## Development

Install dependencies using Bundler and run the local server:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Content can be added under `_projects` for project pages and `_posts` for blog articles.
