# Usama Sadiq Portfolio

This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using the [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme. It showcases my projects and hosts a technical blog.

## Development

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Project pages live in `_projects/` and blog articles in `_posts/`. Navigation links are defined in `_data/navigation.yml`. Static assets such as the resume and profile picture are stored under `assets/`.

The site includes a light/dark theme toggle and simple filtering for projects. Archives for categories and tags are automatically generated using `jekyll-archives`.
