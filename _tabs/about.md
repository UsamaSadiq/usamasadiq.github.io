## üë• Leadership in Open edX

Over the years, I‚Äôve played an active role in improving the developer experience and ecosystem stability for Open edX:

- **Community Leadership**: Championed platform-wide upgrades and modernization projects. Led by example and supported contributors across time zones.
- **Speaker & Advocate**: Delivered technical talks at Open edX conferences, presenting tools, best practices, and sharing behind-the-scenes of high-impact efforts.
- **Mentorship & Onboarding**: Helped onboard new contributors by documenting workflows, simplifying tooling, and guiding them through their first PRs.
- **Standardization & Automation**: Built codemods, scripts, and bots to automate repetitive tasks like PR creation, version bumps, and repository tracking.

## üîß Projects

## üîß Highlight Projects

### üêç Python 3.12 Platform Upgrade
Led the Python 3.12 migration across 10+ critical Open edX services and internal tools.
- Audited dependencies, submitted patches to incompatible upstream packages, and tested under new runtimes.
- Rebuilt Docker images to support Python 3.12, ensured backward compatibility, and upgraded CI workflows accordingly.
- Managed risk across distributed teams by coordinating test freezes, staggered rollouts, and fallback strategies.
- Used CI runners and codemods introduced in earlier projects to accelerate the migration effort.

### üìä Real-Time Analytics Dashboard
Architected a real-time analytics system by integrating RESTful APIs, leveraging Pandas for transformation and computation, and deploying compute logic using AWS Lambda. 
- Configured AWS CloudWatch to monitor application metrics and set up alerts for anomalies.
- Designed data flows that minimized latency and supported on-demand insights for stakeholders.
- Collaborated with frontend developers to expose meaningful data visualizations for operational decision-making.
- Acted as a performance lead to trace bottlenecks and optimize Lambda cold start impact.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Serverless Data Pipeline
Led the design and deployment of a fully serverless, event-driven data pipeline using AWS Lambda, S3, and Secrets Manager.
- Embedded robust error handling and monitoring with CloudWatch logs and custom metrics.
- Integrated API responses with data transformation logic using Pandas, achieving scalability under fluctuating workloads.
- Authored modular Lambda functions reusable across Open edX monitoring tools and data ingestion components.
- Shared this design pattern with the team to inform best practices for other AWS-native projects, including the CI autoscaler and health dashboards.

### üê≥ Containerization and Environment Unification
Migrated over 8 monolithic or script-based services into standardized Docker containers.
- Unified development, staging, and production environments to eliminate "works on my machine" issues.
- Refactored legacy Ansible scripts into clean Dockerfiles and docker-compose configurations.
- Reduced onboarding time for new developers by introducing a self-contained dev environment.
- Coordinated with QA and DevOps to build GitHub Actions-based integration pipelines.

### üìà Open edX Repo Health Dashboard
Created the **Repo Health Dashboard**, a pivotal internal tool to surface real-time insights across 150+ Open edX repositories.
- Visualized repository health, Django upgrade status, stale PRs, CI failures, and contribution trends.
- Integrated data scraping, transformation, and S3-hosted frontend as part of a scalable pipeline.
- Presented this tool at the **Open edX Conference 2024**, promoting it as a community alignment enabler and modernization compass.
- Extended the dashboard to auto-fetch GitHub data using scheduled workflows on GitHub Actions.

### üß© Coordinated Django Upgrade Across Open edX
Spearheaded the ecosystem-wide transition to modern Django versions.
- Established a baseline version matrix for 150+ repos and created automation to track upgrade status.
- Reviewed, refactored, and merged dozens of PRs from community contributors, ensuring consistency.
- Developed codemods and reusable upgrade scripts used by multiple teams.
- Triaged CI failures with custom test matrices and Docker runtime adjustments, working closely with CI and infrastructure teams.

### üîÑ CI/CD Revamp and GitHub Actions Migration
Transformed the CI/CD architecture by replacing legacy Jenkins, CircleCI, and Travis CI pipelines with GitHub Actions.
- Set up autoscaling GitHub runners on AWS EKS using Kubernetes, HPA, and cluster-autoscaler integrations.
- Authored shared GitHub Actions consumed across internal and community repositories to ensure consistency.
- Documented the full CI stack migration to help onboard Open edX community members.
- Reduced CI cost and improved reliability, unlocking faster feedback cycles for developers.
