## üë• Leadership in Open edX

Over the years, I‚Äôve played an active role in improving the developer experience and ecosystem stability for Open edX:

- **Community Leadership**: Championed platform-wide upgrades and modernization projects. Led by example and supported contributors across time zones.
- **Speaker & Advocate**: Delivered technical talks at Open edX conferences, presenting tools, best practices, and sharing behind-the-scenes of high-impact efforts.
- **Mentorship & Onboarding**: Helped onboard new contributors by documenting workflows, simplifying tooling, and guiding them through their first PRs.
- **Standardization & Automation**: Built codemods, scripts, and bots to automate repetitive tasks like PR creation, version bumps, and repository tracking.
