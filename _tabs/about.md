## 🔧 Highlight Projects

### 📊 Real-Time Analytics Dashboard
Developed a real-time analytics dashboard by integrating RESTful APIs, using Pandas for data processing and AWS Lambda for compute. CloudWatch was configured to track application health and performance.

### ☁️ Serverless Data Pipeline
Built an event-driven data transformation pipeline on AWS Lambda, storing data in S3, and integrating Secrets Manager for secure configuration. Focused on reliability and observability using CloudWatch logs.

### 🐳 Docker Environment Standardization
Migrated 8+ legacy services to containerized workflows using Docker. Standardized local, staging, and production environments to eliminate inconsistencies and reduce developer onboarding time.

### 📈 Open edX Repo Health Dashboard
Created the **Repo Health Dashboard** to visualize the status of 150+ repositories across the Open edX GitHub ecosystem. The tool helped track Django upgrade progress and highlighted stale repos, CI failures, and community activity. 

Presented this tool at the **Open edX Conference 2024**, where I shared insights on platform health, the importance of maintaining open-source hygiene, and strategies to drive community-wide modernization.

### 🧩 Community-Driven Django Upgrade
Led the modernization effort for Django upgrades across the Open edX ecosystem. Coordinated with dozens of contributors, reviewed and merged PRs, resolved blockers, and ensured version consistency across repositories. Enabled large-scale coordination through technical leadership and communication.

### 🔄 CI Infrastructure & GitHub Migration
Overhauled CI pipelines by migrating Jenkins and CircleCI setups to GitHub Actions. Designed reusable workflows, implemented dynamic autoscaling runners on Kubernetes, and published shared actions for internal and community use.

### 🐍 Python 3.12 Migration
Spearheaded the Python 3.12 upgrade for over 10 major services. Updated Dockerfiles, dependencies, and CI workflows, collaborated on upstream fixes, and ensured compatibility across the stack.
