title: edX Institution Scraper
---

This project includes a Python script that scrapes edX partner pages to collect the first course offered by each institution. It uses Selenium WebDriver for dynamic content and writes results incrementally to a CSV file. Detailed instructions and usage notes are available in the legacy page `legacy_projects/scrappers/edx_scrapper.html`.
