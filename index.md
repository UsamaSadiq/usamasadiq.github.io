Welcome to my personal portfolio built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

## About Me

Hi! I'm Usama Sadiq — a passionate Backend Developer and DevOps Engineer who loves automating things, building scalable systems, and solving real-world problems through code. I'm currently working at Arbisoft, where I contribute to the edX project, dabble with AWS magic, and occasionally geek out over cool tech stuff. When I'm not knee-deep in Python or battling with Docker containers, you'll probably find me lost in a good book, binge-watching anime, or sketching out ideas for my next side project.

## Education

- **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS)**, Information Technology University (ITU) Lahore, Pakistan, 2014–2018 — Graduated with honors focusing on software engineering, algorithms, and cloud computing technologies.

## Skills & Expertise

I have 6+ years of experience working with Python, Django, React, MySQL, Docker, AWS, Kubernetes, and CI/CD technologies. I specialize in building scalable backend systems and optimizing infrastructure. I am responsible for leading migrations, resolving high-priority issues, and developing tools that improve the developer experience.
